# United-Airlines-NYSE-vs-Tweets
(This is a work in progress.)  

The abundance of data generated by Twitter users has attracted the interest of those wishing to predict fluctuations in the stock market.  The basic idea is that certain emotional aspects of the ['Twittersphere'](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/twittersphere) at any given moment can predict investor activity.  Some success has been achieved already, with researchers correlating certain aspects of the mood of the Twittersphere with Dow Jones Industrial Averages several days later ([see here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.3003.pdf)).  

Personally, I was curious to see if the mood of tweets directed at or referring to a specific company could be used to predict the stock prices of that company.  I chose to do a time-series analysis of United Airlines' (UAL) NYSE quote values vs. the sentiment of tweets discussing United Airlines.  I gathered about 3 weeks worth of tweets about United Airlines using Twitter's Streaming API, as well as minute-by-minute quotes of United stock activity using Google Finance.


First, I gathered tweets using Tweepy and MongoDB (using RoboMongo as a GUI) ([see code](https://github.com/TheresaBrons/United-Airlines-NYSE-vs-Tweets/blob/master/StreamUALTweetsNoOutput.ipynb)).  I also gathered UAL stock prices from Google Finance, which is just one of [several ways](https://www.quantshare.com/sa-426-6-ways-to-download-free-intraday-and-tick-data-for-the-us-stock-market) to do so.  

## Outline:
* ### Cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis and visualization
[This code](https://github.com/TheresaBrons/United-Airlines-NYSE-vs-Tweets/blob/master/CleanUALQuotes.ipynb) formats the .txt file downloaded from Google Finance.  In particular, I wanted to fix the time-stamps, which were given in a strange format.
* ### Visualizations of the raw data using matplotlib and pylab
#### Visualizing the NYSE United Airlines stock prices

Here is the [code](https://github.com/TheresaBrons/United-Airlines-NYSE-vs-Tweets/blob/master/UnitedQuotesVisualization.ipynb).

The graph below graphs the stock prices as they change over time.  The large linear portions are due to 'connecting the dots' during the process of graphing and do not correspond with actual data points.  The vertical red lines indicate market openings.

The next graph shows the distribution of the stock prices over the same time period.

Because the stock prices were neither normally distributed nor stationary, I took the first difference, i.e. the change in between one quote and the next quote.  The next graph shows how the stock price is changing over time.

You can see that the distribution of the changes of the stock prices is much more well-behaved:

#### Visualizing Tweets about United Airlines

Here is the [code](https://github.com/TheresaBrons/United-Airlines-NYSE-vs-Tweets/blob/master/UnitedTweetVisualization.ipynb) for the visualizations below.  First is a graph of the frequency of the top 25 most frequent words.

Finally, here is a wordcloud made from the tweets.  They were gathered from May 22 to June 11, and you might notice some major events affecting United Airlines during that time showing up in the tweets.  For example, it was during this time that United announced it would stop offering flights to Venezuela in July, 2017.  

Also evident is the fact that Twitters language filter failed to ignore Spanish tweets, despite the use of the English filter in the streaming code.  Perhaps simply having the (English) key words "united airlines" in the tweet was enough for Twitter to qualify it as English.  (Having seen many English tweets filled with abbreviations and internet slang, I would expect a more stringent language filter would throw out too many tweets!)
