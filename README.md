# United-Airlines-NYSE-vs-Tweets
This is a work in progress.  It will be a time-series analysis of UAL NYSE quotes vs. sentiment analysis tweets discussing United Airlines using PyFlux.  I am curious to see whether the average sentiment of tweets about United Airlines can be used to predict fluctuations in the price of UAL stock on the NYSE. **post link to the article about it that got me interested**  In particular, I am interested in using Granger Causality analysis.  

I do not expect that I'll end up seeing that tweet sentiment will be useful in predicting UAL stock prices, especially when informations was gathered over such a short period.  However, I do expect to have a lot of fun learning about time-series analyses and sharing my results! 

I have already gathered tweets using Tweepy and MongoDB (using RoboMongo as a GUI), and the code for doing so can be found here: **need to post link after I upload it**  

I plan on doing and sharing the code for the following:
* Cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis and visualization
* Visualizations of the raw data using matplotlib
* Time-series analysis on the UAL quotes
* Times-series analysis on the UAL quotes vs. tweet sentiment averaged over time
